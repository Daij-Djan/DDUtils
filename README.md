#About
this is a VERY loose collection of individual classes and/or components for OSX/IOS that I find myself reusing serveral times and so thought it that it might be good to make them available.

Most of the classes are arent meant or even guaranteed to be feature complete. Originally, they were developed for a very specific use case. They were/are all used in one or the other published app and then I thought I'd make them available to the general public.</b>

- new classes will be in swift (and sometimes in objC as well) but the 'old' objective-C classes are useful and still up to date too and I won't port all old code.

##Individual Classes
###Swift
